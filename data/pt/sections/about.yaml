# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a hardworking, motivated and introverted, but sociable, individual. I have a special interest in finding solutions to problems that you do not yet have. Early music is a passion that I would adore making into a real part of my net worth. Still, engineering is a way of thinking that can be applied to a multitude of problems. Right now, and given the current times, I am switching gears into my original field: this means getting back to university and restarting a whole new learning process.'
